# Boilerplate for a cleaned up CRA Project.

Most unneeded files have been removed. This will save the time it takes to install CRA and remove the files at the beginning of the project.

# CRA team has updated the render method with createRoot for React v18.

There will be no need to update the render method @ index.js.
